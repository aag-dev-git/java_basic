# Java Core Concepts Project

This project demonstrates fundamental and object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts in Java. It serves as a practical reference for understanding essential Java features through simple, well-structured examples.

## üìÅ Topics Covered

- **Constructor**  
  Understand how constructors are used to initialize objects and different types of constructors (default, parameterized, copy).

- **Core Concepts**  
  Covers foundational Java topics such as data types, control structures, arrays, and loops.

- **Enum**  
  Learn how to use `enum` types for defining fixed sets of constants in Java.

- **OOPs - Abstraction**  
  Demonstrates hiding implementation details using abstract classes and interfaces.

- **OOPs - Encapsulation**  
  Shows how to restrict direct access to object data using private variables and public methods (getters/setters).

- **OOPs - Inheritance**  
  Explains how a class can inherit properties and behavior from another class using `extends`.

- **OOPs - Polymorphism**  
  Includes examples of method overloading and method overriding to demonstrate compile-time and runtime polymorphism.

- **Operators**  
  Covers different types of operators in Java like arithmetic, logical, relational, assignment, etc.

- **`super` Keyword**  
  Illustrates how to access superclass methods and constructors using the `super` keyword.

- **`this` Keyword**  
  Shows how the `this` keyword is used to refer to the current class instance and resolve naming conflicts.

- **Types of Classes**  
  Explore different class types in Java such as:
  - Regular classes
  - Abstract classes
  - Final classes
  - Inner classes
  - Anonymous classes

## üîß How to Run

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the project in your favorite IDE (e.g., IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, VS Code).
3. Navigate to the relevant topic package/folder.
4. Run the Java files with a `main()` method to see output and behavior.
