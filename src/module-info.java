/**
 * A module in Java is a way to group related packages, resources, and a module
 * descriptor. It was introduced in Java 9 as part of the Java Platform Module
 * System (JPMS). The module descriptor, named module-info.java, specifies the
 * module's name, dependencies, exported packages, provided services, consumed
 * services, and allowed reflection. Modules enhance code organization,
 * encapsulation, and maintainability by explicitly declaring dependencies and
 * controlling access to packages. They improve application integrity and
 * simplify the management of large projects by breaking them down into smaller,
 * self-contained units.
