	 * Lambda expression is a new and important feature of Java which was included
	 * in Java SE 8. It provides a clear and concise way to represent one method
	 * interface using an expression. It is very useful in collection library. It
	 * helps to iterate, filter and extract data from collection. The Lambda
	 * expression is used to provide the implementation of an interface which has
	 * functional interface. It saves a lot of code. In case of lambda expression,
	 * we don't need to define the method again for providing the implementation.
	 * Here, we just write the implementation code. Java lambda expression is
	 * treated as a function, so compiler does not create .class file.
