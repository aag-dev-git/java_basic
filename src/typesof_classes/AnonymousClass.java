	 * An Anonymous Inner Class is a class defined without a name, and it is
	 * instantiated at the same time it is defined. It is often used when you need a
	 * short-term implementation of an interface or a subclass, typically to
	 * override a method or implement a specific behavior.
	 * 
	 * The class doesn't have a name and is defined and instantiated in a single
	 * expression.
	 * 
	 * You cannot define a constructor for an anonymous inner class. The compiler
	 * automatically calls the constructor of the parent class.
	 * 
	 * Anonymous inner classes in Java provide a simple way to create one-off
	 * implementations of classes or interfaces. They are commonly used for event
	 * handling, threading, and callback mechanisms, and help reduce boilerplate
	 * code.
