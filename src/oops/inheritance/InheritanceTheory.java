	 * ðŸŒŸ INHERITANCE IN JAVA - KEY POINTS AND DEFINITIONS ðŸŒŸ
	 *
	 * 1. What is Inheritance?
	 * ------------------------
	 * Inheritance is an OOP concept where one class (subclass) inherits properties 
	 * and methods from another class (superclass).
	 * It helps with code reusability, organization, and supports polymorphism.
	 *
	 * Syntax:
	 *   class ChildClass extends ParentClass {
	 *       // new fields and methods
	 *   }
	 *
	 *
	 * 2. Superclass (Parent Class)
	 * -----------------------------
	 * A superclass is the class that provides methods and fields to be inherited.
	 *
	 * Example:
	 *   class Animal {
	 *       public void eat() {
	 *           System.out.println("Animal eats food.");
	 *       }
	 *   }
	 *
	 *
	 * 3. Subclass (Child Class)
	 * --------------------------
	 * A subclass inherits from the superclass and can have its own methods.
	 *
	 * Example:
	 *   class Dog extends Animal {
	 *       public void bark() {
	 *           System.out.println("Dog barks.");
	 *       }
	 *   }
	 *
	 *
	 * 4. Method Overriding
	 * ---------------------
	 * A subclass can override a method of the superclass to provide its own version.
	 *
	 * Example:
	 *   @Override
	 *   public void eat() {
	 *       System.out.println("Dog eats bones.");
	 *   }
	 *
	 *
	 * 5. Code Reusability
	 * --------------------
	 * You don't need to write the same code again â€” you inherit it from the parent class.
	 *
	 *
	 * 6. Types of Inheritance in Java
	 * --------------------------------
	 * âœ” Single Inheritance          â†’ One child, one parent
	 * âœ” Multilevel Inheritance      â†’ A â†’ B â†’ C
	 * âœ” Hierarchical Inheritance    â†’ One parent, multiple children
	 * âœ˜ Multiple Inheritance (with classes) â†’ Not supported directly (only via interfaces)
	 *
	 *
	 * 7. Access Modifiers and Inheritance
	 * ------------------------------------
	 * public      â†’ Accessible everywhere
	 * protected   â†’ Accessible in same package + subclasses
	 * default     â†’ Accessible only within the same package
	 * private     â†’ Not accessible in subclass
	 *
	 *
	 * 8. The `super` Keyword
	 * -----------------------
	 * Used to refer to parent class:
	 *   - super.method() â†’ Call parent method
	 *   - super()        â†’ Call parent constructor (must be first line in constructor)
	 *
	 *
	 * 9. Advantages of Inheritance
	 * -----------------------------
	 * âœ… Reuse existing code
	 * âœ… Improve readability and organization
	 * âœ… Allows method overriding
	 * âœ… Enables polymorphism
	 * âœ… Easier maintenance and upgrades
	 *
	 *
	 * ðŸ”š Summary:
	 * Inheritance is like a child getting traits from a parent.
	 * It keeps your code DRY (Donâ€™t Repeat Yourself) and helps manage complexity.
