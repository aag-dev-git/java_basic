	 * ðŸ”„ POLYMORPHISM IN JAVA - THEORY NOTES ðŸ”„
	 *
	 * 1. What is Polymorphism?
	 * -------------------------
	 * âž¤ Polymorphism means "many forms".
	 * âž¤ It allows objects to perform different behaviors (methods) through a common interface or name.
	 * âž¤ In Java, polymorphism is mainly achieved through:
	 *      - Method Overloading (Compile-time)
	 *      - Method Overriding (Runtime)
	 *
	 *
	 * 2. Types of Polymorphism:
	 * --------------------------
	 * âœ… Compile-time Polymorphism (Static Binding)
	 *    âž¤ Achieved using Method Overloading.
	 *    âž¤ Method has the same name but different parameters (number/type/order).
	 *
	 * âœ… Runtime Polymorphism (Dynamic Binding)
	 *    âž¤ Achieved using Method Overriding.
	 *    âž¤ A subclass provides a specific implementation of a method already defined in its superclass.
	 *    âž¤ The method to be executed is determined during runtime based on the actual object.
	 *
	 *
	 * 3. Advantages of Polymorphism:
	 * -------------------------------
	 * âœ” Code reusability and flexibility
	 * âœ” Method behavior can vary at runtime
	 * âœ” Clean and maintainable code
	 * âœ” Supports dynamic method dispatch
	 * âœ” Essential for abstraction and interface-based design
	 *
	 *
	 * ðŸ”š Summary:
	 * -------------------------------
	 * âž¤ Polymorphism allows one interface to be used for a general class of actions.
	 * âž¤ The actual action is determined by the specific object at runtime (or overload at compile time).
	 * âž¤ A key principle of OOP along with inheritance, encapsulation, and abstraction.
